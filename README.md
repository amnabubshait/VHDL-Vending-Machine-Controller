# VHDL-Vending-Machine
The Vending Machine Controller project seeks to develop and implement a VHDL-based digital vending machine system that mimics real-world operations. The project will use a finite state machine (FSM) for controlling the vending machine's various states, which include idle, accepting money, dispensing items, and returning change.
