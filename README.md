# VHDL Vending Machine Controller

The Vending Machine Controller project seeks to develop and implement a VHDL-based digital vending machine system that mimics real-world operations. The project will use a finite state machine (FSM) for controlling the vending machine's various states, which include idle, accepting money, dispensing items, and returning change.

This project will demonstrate the design and implementation of a VHDL state machine that regulates the functioning of a vending machine. The project is going to concentrate on digital circuit principles, state transitions, and user input management, allowing theoretical topics to be applied in practice.
